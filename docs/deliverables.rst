 DELIVERABLES
==============

Hardware
--------

The product hardware should consist of a camera with zoom
capabilities, that can be panned and tilted. Everything should be
controlled via a USB connection to the receiver unit which runs the
control software.

Software
--------

We want to deliver two seperate software components. The first
component is the software which handles input data from nearby
aircrafts. The software will compute the angle between the aircraft
and the camera and stream video footage. This component runs on the
Skysense v2. The second component is a web interface that presents the
video footage. In an eventual final product this should be the
Flightradar24 website but in our prototype we shall have a standalone
website that runs on a web server that handles the streamed video and
shows it to a customer.

Documentation
-------------

We will deliver documentation with all necessary information about the
software and hardware for Flightradar24 to continue working on our
project. This is extra important since our product is a
proof-of-concept and will be further developed after our course is
over.
